While I'm still here, here are my thoughts on instagram.

Pros:
 - community
 - cool engineering scale problem
 - there's good content

Cons:
 - ad central ( is there anything that is actually free ? )
 - privacy
 - addictive
 - meta will train AI with your data
 - algorithm that knows more about you than you

Bring back the casual simplistic instagram in like 2013.
