In general my thoughts are very scattered. I hope that with time will come clarity of my thoughts.

So tomorrow I'm going skiing and for some reason I thought it was the perfect time to start a blog. It took 5 years to even start, and who knows if I will keep going. I've seen too many tech blogs just die off for 10+ years and suddently come back. It's like every time I've hiked in the White Mountains and I have to wake up at 6AM I never get sleep. Also, love skiing but I'm worried about my bank account.
