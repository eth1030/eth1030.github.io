I'm a bit concerned by having my info online, but hopefully with common sense I can circumvent any dire security issues. My first concern was image metadata revealing my location. So I ran the following:
```
for img in *.*; do
# Get the filename without extension
filename="${img%.*}"
# Convert to PNG
sips -s format png "$img" --out "${filename}.png"
done

# Strip all metadata from the PNGs using exiftool
for png in *.png; do
exiftool -all= "$png"
# exiftool creates a _original backup by default, remove it if you want
rm -f "${png}_original"
done
```
The next thing I'm concerned about is probably AI scraping my data? but I feel like there are more important things I need to worry about first like the state of this site :)
