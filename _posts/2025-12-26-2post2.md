Good luck to anyone who reads this.

I feel like studying engineering made me a bit illiterate ...

So of course the best time to create my first website is right before a ski trip. I have been dreaming of a "portfolio" site for over 5 years, and 2 years ago I made a "Hello world!" site. There's a lot of legendary tech blogs that haven't been updated in over 10 years -- not saying I'm legendary but I bet this blog will become just like that. 

I don't know why everytime I have a hike in the White Mountains the next day (and have to wake up at 6) I'm always up late (skiing in this case).
